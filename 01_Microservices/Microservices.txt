==================
Before Microservices
==================
1. Monolithic architecture: Mulitple components are combined in single large app.
2. Single Code Base
3. Deployed in single bundle
4. Drawbacks:- Change in one service then whole app is redeployed.
5. Building Problem:- Developers has to communicate
6. Problem in Scale(large codebase)
7. Cumbersome(extreme tedious) over time.

==================
Microservices
==================
1. Large apps are divide into small parts.
2. Different Codebase
3. Each module managed independently
4. Different tech stack
5. Drawback:- Handling microservices is complex.

==================
What we are going to build to Master Microservices
==================

1. We are creating three services :- Hotel Service, User Service, Rating Service
2. All 3 Services will use three different database for themselves.
3. We are using github config server in config service.
4. Client will directly communicate with api gateway and then services.
5. Providing Authentication with OKTA Auth.
6. We have to register all these servies in ServiceRegistery Services where all services are centrallized.
7. All Services will run at different port at runtime parallely on service registry.
